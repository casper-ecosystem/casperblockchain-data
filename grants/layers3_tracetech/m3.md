### Description

### User Flow deployment

In this final phase, the only thing left will be the integration of the functionalities into a common frontend (a web app). Here, the user will have to interact with their wallet to access their NFTs. Also, all the necessary user documentation for the use of this new tool will have to be generated. Finally, the initial user training will need to be set-up (250-500 Alpha users).


### Acceptance Criteria

- Have initial NFTs generated (one for each user activated at the time of the milestone).
- Have a demo user with each of the possible NFTs (depending on their rarity and their traceability) to be able to make product demonstrations and marketing.
- Have prepared a joint marketing campaign with Casper to disseminate the communication of this project when it comes to market.
- Have the technical documentation generated and linked to the web app so that the user can know and understand the flow transparently at all times.
- App integrated in Layers (layers.hemav.com). You can see traceability of the coffee and certificate of non deforestation, with code or QR.
- As an extra point, there could be an acceptance criterion which is to perform a demo of the happy path process to Casper.
