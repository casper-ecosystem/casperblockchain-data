### Description

Integration with the Metacask Marketplace where Helix markets would enable the direct purchase of Casks via other cryptocurrencies by acting as a payments processor - p2p payments. This type of integration can be potentially extended to any other Casper Network marketplace.
Example of use case Flow:
Marketplace transaction C2C (customer to customer) payments. Marketplace would enable the customers to pay for secondary trades. Customer A sells NFT on the Casper Network and is willing to accept ETH or USCD (on the Ethereum Network) as payment. Customer B buys this NFT using ETH that he has. In order for this to occur they would be onboarded on Helix if they chose this payment flow.
Upon execution the funds of user B would flow into the Metacask account and Metacask would send the NFT to User B and Payment to user A.

Deliverables:

- Creation of a wallet stack for Metacasks users
- payment API between Metacask and Helix
 ▪  first part of API User registration
 ▪ second API Payment instructions
- Open sourcing the API SDK making it generally available for any Casper Network marketplace to connect to Helix Markets
- Integration with the Metacask UI/UX payment flow

### Acceptance Criteria
Metacask users can pay for Casks using their Helix wallets in different crypto currencies.
