### Description
### Swaps inside the wallet (via SimpleSwap.io)

**Details of what will be delivered in this milestone:**
This version of the wallet includes an integration with the cryptocurrency exchange, Dspense Wallet - https://dspense.com/wallet. This integration allows for swaps between CSPR and major other cryptocurrencies, providing the user with more options to manage their digital assets.

The implementation of this integration will be done in a way that allows users to perform operations within the Telegram client, without having to leave the platform. This includes operations such as token swaps, except for sending tokens to and from other wallets, which may require using a separate wallet/exchange.


### Acceptance Criteria

The deliverable for the integration with https://dspense.com/ is a fully functional version of the crypto wallet that allows users to perform token swaps between CSPR and major cryptocurrencies within the Telegram client, except for sending tokens to and from other wallets. The code will be open-sourced, allowing for transparency and collaboration with the community.

The acceptance criteria for this integration would include:

- Ability to perform token swaps between CSPR and other major cryptocurrencies within the Telegram client.
- The code should be open-sourced and accessible to the public.
- The functionality should be tested and working correctly without any major bugs or technical issues.
- The user experience should be seamless and straightforward, allowing users to easily perform token swaps within the Telegram client.
