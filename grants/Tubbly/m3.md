### Description

AirDrop functionality & CEP-18 integration

The objective of this milestone is to build a new module of the app that will enable the users to see the tokens on the map.
The AirDrop mode will enable the user to collect the CEP-18 tokens from other projects built on Casper (the first AirDrop on Tubbly will be Fatso). The user will see the Fatso tokens on the map, and at the end of the airdrop campaign will receive the FATSO tokens to their account in the Tubbly app.
Once the front end of the AirDrop module is ready, the CEP-18 support is to be integrated. This will enable the projects from the Casper ecosystem to payout the tokens for the AirDrop participants, straight into the user's wallet within the Tubbly app.


### Acceptance Criteria

The first step to develop the AirDrop module is to prepare the front end of the App.
Once the user switch to the AirDrop mode, the look and feel of the application will be adjusted:
- Users can see AirDropped tokens on the map
- Users can receive the AirDropped CEP-18 tokens into their account within the Tubbly app
- Users can transfer their CEP-18 tokens to a different account.
- Multiple CEP-18 tokens can be displayed in users' wallets.
