Tubbly is a lifestyle app that gamifies shopping by allowing users to collect tokens in their local area using an interactive 3D map and exchange them for rewards and discounts from partner businesses. The app features a user dashboard to track balances, rewards history, and achievements, and integrates with the Casper Blockchain to manage user balances securely through smart contracts. Future plans include enabling users to maintain their private keys for direct blockchain interaction and expanding transaction history on the blockchain for detailed account tracking.
