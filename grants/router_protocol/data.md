Router's CrossTalk is an extensible cross-chain framework that enables seamless state transitions across multiple chains. In simple terms, this library leverages Router's infrastructure to allow contracts on one chain to communicate with contracts deployed on some other chain. The library is structured in a way that it can be integrated seamlessly into your development environment to allow for cross-chain message passing without disturbing other parts of your product.

Before diving deep into Router's stateful bridging capabilities, it is important to understand what it actually means. In the context of decentralized systems, a stateful entity is one that has a “brain” to persist past data in its memory and perform computation on the fly. For example, smart contracts are considered stateful because they allow users to perform computations on the blockchain and store data in the form of variables. Extending this concept to blockchain interoperability, a stateful bridging infrastructure allows applications built on it to implement custom bridging logic. In other words, a stateful bridge can perform case-based routing.

A stateless bridge, on the other hand, does not support storage or computation. It simply routes a cross-chain transaction from the source chain to the destination chain as it is. To have case-based routing with a stateless bridge, applications must lay out all the scenarios in contracts deployed across all the chains, which adds too much overhead. On chains like Ethereum, performing computation might even be costly, so it would make much more sense to delegate the computation to a cheaper stateful middleware.
