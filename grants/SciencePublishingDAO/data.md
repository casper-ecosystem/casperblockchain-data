The problem with paywalls has been widely recognized and re-spawned the Open Science Movement – which includes the Open Access Movement and Guerilla Open Access Movement. Projects such as ArXiv (preprint journal), PLOS One (major Open Access journal), Allen Institute (privately-owned Open Science Center), and Sci-Hub (pirated access to journals) are examples of non-traditional ways of publishing and accessing knowledge.
Governments around the globe have also been funding Open Access programs such as SPARC, MIT’s Center for Collective Intelligence (MITCCI), Center for Open Science (COS), Open Research Europe (ORE), Research Center for Open Science and Data Platform (RCOS) etc. The US’s Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006 required any US Federal Government Agency with a research budget greater than $100M to create an open access repository – this applies to 11 US agencies including NASA, EPA etc. With greater and greater frequency, universities are mandating their researchers to exclusively publish in Open Access Journals, some of which are government funded. These initiatives incite pushback from the commercial sector, including the instantiation of policies like SOPA, PROTECT IP Act, and Research Works Act, while evading the “Open Access” political barrage by using their brands to create high-profit and profile Open Access Journals.
ORE was started and continues to be funded by the European Commission (EC). On behalf of ORE, the EC contractually pays F1000, a publisher, a flat fee of 780 EUR/paper to market ORE published papers on F1000’s platform. Usually, publishing in Open Access Journals costs $10+k/paper - normally papers cost up to $8k. This focus on Open Science/Access, though romantic, has from a macro perspective inadvertently hurt not-for-profit Professional Societies and shifted the costs from the readers to the authors while barely denting the wallets or position of Big Publishing.
Since the invention of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) in 2016, there have been several attempts to address the problems of Open Science. A project called Open Access DAO recently launched (11/2021), with the goal of crowdsourcing funds to buy journals to quickly make their contents open-access. Most of these blockchain-based solutions for decentralize science (DeSci) address the paper access issue, but very rarely do any of the current projects address the governance or the reputation infrastructure of academic science. These neglected issues are arguably more responsible for the state of science today. Previous attempts to change the reputation and governance metrics via gamification have failed.
