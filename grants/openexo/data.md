OpenExO no longer wants to operate in the L1 space as they do not want to build and
maintain nodes and deal with security, network stability, and associated network
maintenance issues, which is costly.
OpenExO aims to migrate their ecosystem from their proprietary Coin (EXOS) and L1
blockchain (bitcoin fork network) to Casper and has engaged Casper Labs Services to
own and manage this migration process.
We anticipate that this migration effort will cover up to 10,000 active addresses, but note
that the EXO community consists of 23,250 members, so this will only grow with time as
EXO advances and expands its platform offerings.
