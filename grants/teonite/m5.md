### Description

Example web page that will enable the user to input a deployment from mainnet and: 
See if itâ€™s validated or not
If validated see the source code

### Acceptance Criteria

React component as a library that can be used in other React pages that enables one to use it and style it accordingly to the web page (cspr.live from what we see uses React). It will automatically display if the deployment is validated or not, and if it is - it will show a source code browser.
