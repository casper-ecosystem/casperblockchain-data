### Description
### Read-only Telegram wallet client

**Details of what will be delivered in this milestone:**
A read-only wallet is a trimmed-down version of a full-fledged wallet, where we request the public key and monitor the wallet's activity based on it. From the functionality described below, it will have:

- Login
- Balance
- History
- Settings (reduced functionality)
- Notifications

The goal of this client is to provide an additional way for users to interact with the Casper Blockchain, for those who prefer not to change from their current wallet.

This client will be utilizing the library from Milestone #1.
