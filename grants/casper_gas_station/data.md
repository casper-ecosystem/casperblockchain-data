Last month (09/2023), we ran a successful “Free of Fee” marketing campaign which
gained more than 400 new users with 935 on-chain actions within 14 days.
A BIG question pops up while we distribute the transaction fee to participants: “Is there
any on-chain solution that we can allow Casper User to do on-chain actions without any
gas fee?”
That’s the reason why we came up with a gasless solution: Casper Gas Station (CGS).
We strongly believe that with Casper Gas Station, Social Login from cspr.click or usewallet
can help Casper Ecosystem create the next wave of mass adoption.
