### Description

User interaction with the blockchain

Every time a user claims the tokens on the map the balance gets updated on the contract. Currently all the deploys come from the Tubbly main account. The balance is associated with the user's account hash. The objective of this milestone is to associate private keys with users and each deploy will be signed by the user not by main Tubbly account
