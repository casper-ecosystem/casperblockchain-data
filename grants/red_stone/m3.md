### Description

Implement a few simple Casper smart contracts using Casper-connector.
● Implement basic consumer smart contract examples, which use the Redstone
numeric values
● Prepare smart contract tests for the sample contracts using mock signers and
mock data packages
● Prepare integration testing scripts with the real RedStone oracle data



### Acceptance Criteria

Definition of done: Casper added to our Showroom (https://showroom.redstone.finance/) - a platform aggregating test integrations done on chains we are deployed to so Builders can have an example on how our infrastructure should be implemented.
