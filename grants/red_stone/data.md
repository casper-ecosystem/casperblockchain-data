RedStone is a modular Oracle infrastructure that keeps data off-chain in the RedStone Data Distribution Layer (DDL) and pushes it on EVM chains via attaching signed data packages to user transactions call-data (more details on the flow in the Docs).

RedStone offers a few data consumption models:
RedStone Classic - relayer pushes prices to storage using an interface known to popular protocols based on specific heartbeat & deviation thresholds,
RedStone Core - Every dApp user fetches the price feeds automatically injected into a transaction,

Itâ€™s not certain that all models will be achievable on Casper, therefore our team will initiate the integration process with a comprehensive research phase. During this phase, we will determine which model is the most suitable for the Casper Network and devise a strategy for delivering our price feeds effectively. If our research concludes that the Classic model is the optimal approach for providing our Data Feeds on Casper, it's important to note that there will be additional responsibilities in terms of relayer maintenance and associated gas costs, depending on the amount of feeds ecosystem projects would need. (We can charge projects or chat with you about subsidizing those feeds going forward).
So far builders in the Casper Ecosystem have been restricted by the lack of diversified and custom data feeds. But now RedStone comes with a unique value proposition: Frequently updated data feeds covering all the data you need for your Casper dApp. We keep data off-chain (in a decentralized and secure manner) and optimize how it's extracted by dApps. That's how we leveraged the RedStone innovative infrastructure to create a dedicated implementation offering versatile data feeds - asset prices, NFTs, stocks, commodities, and much, much more. We usually approach every integration individually and roll out the feeds depending on client needs.
