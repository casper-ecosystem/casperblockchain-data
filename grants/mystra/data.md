Mystra is a multichain SocialFi platform with aggregated DeFi tools made for users and project creators, focused mainly on Incubation and Launchpad modules.

We solve critical user problems in Web3. We are the go-to platform for new and non-technical users. Providing all tools they need, from getting first crypto to investing in projects - in one place. With focus on safety, unique engagement reward system and socialFi aspects encourage even the users with small funds and knowledge to participate in projects built on the platform.

We also help builders with our technical knowledge, APIs and even no-code tools. After solving user problems we can really make incubated projects shine, involve the gathered community and make real symbiosis between them and creators. Our multichain UI allows projects and users to open to the whole blockchain ecosystem, allowing users to see content from chains they donâ€™t know yet.

This will make a great impact on adoption of blockchains like Casper Network.

Our SocialFi multichain platform integrates diverse DeFi tools, catering to both users and project creators. Primarily, we emphasize Incubation and Launchpad modules. In the realm of Web3, we address critical user challenges, being the preferred choice for newcomers and non-tech-savvy individuals. We consolidate essential tools, guiding users from their first crypto experience to project investments, all within a unified platform. Emphasizing safety, our unique engagement rewards and SocialFi elements empower even those with limited funds and knowledge to actively participate in platform projects.

We also help builders with our tech. knowledge, APIs and even no-code tools. After solving user problems we can really make incubated projects shine, involve the gathered community and make real symbiosis between them & creators. Our multichain UI allows projects and users to open to the blockchains world.This will make a great impact on adoption of blockchains like Casper Network.

Mystra project will empower Casper ecosystem in various ways. We have prepared some key concepts for integration and implementation among our platform.
Here are the entire bullet points of benefits for Casper and the ways to achieve it:

Integrating casper wallets addresses into registration and login is one of the initial steps for users on the Mystra platform. This involves integrating Casper Wallet and other compatible wallets that adhere to the Casper Network public key standard.
Display integration of CEP47, CEP78, CEP18, and CEP20 tokens in the wallet module on the Mystra platform.
Integration that allows users to interact with and manage the aforementioned tokens.

Integration of the "Fiat Payment Gateway" allowing users to purchase CSPR tokens using fiat currencies (FIAT) directly with VISA, MASTER CARD payment cards, via the BLIK system, Google Pay and Apple Pay.
Frontend integration allowing users to exchange CSPR tokens on the network (multichain) for other tokens from different networks through the Bridge.
Integration of the DAO management and voting module with smart contracts on the Casper network.

Integration of no-code tools allowing users to quickly and easily create their own tokens on the Casper network.
Integration of the Casper Network into the Mystra NFT Marketplace (Creator Studio for NFT CEP47 and CEP78). Creator Studio supported by integrated AI for image generation (Dall-E).Integration of the Web3 communicator. Users can create chats, groups (guilds) and conduct private encrypted conversations with other users using their Casper Network public keys. Sending messages to the recipient occurs after signing the message with a wallet compliant with the Casper Network standard, such as Casper Wallet.
Providing access to our Casper Network node parser API in real-time (SSE). Access not only to structured/parsed basic data such as blocks, deploys, contracts but also data such as analytics of behaviors and actions carried out on the network. For example, endpoints related to owned CEP tokens by specific public key addresses.

Integration of Casper Network for DEX/SWAP and liquidity pool (LP) fields.
Integration of smart contracts fulfilling Incubation Hub & Launchpad tasks.
