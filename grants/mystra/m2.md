### Description

Each project/startup aspiring to partake in the incubation process and secure a spot on theMystra Launchpad must undergo registration on the Mystra platform in the form of a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). To facilitate this, we provide an intuitive, codeless wizard that guides through the entire registration process. During the incubation phase, the community actively engages by proposing ideas and casting votes in favor or against, signaling their interest in the ongoing project. This participatory process extends beyond project interest to encompass decisions related to the project's developmental trajectory and the chosen solutions.


### Acceptance Criteria

DAO GOVERNANCE:
1. A user with a verified status can initiate the creation of a DAO on the Mystra platform using a codeless wizard for every DAO project established on Mystra.
2. Upon successful verification, the DAO becomes visible in the Mystra platform's "projects" module.
3. A project (DAO) profile page with comprehensive information becomes accessible to all Mystra users.
4. Users can submit proposals:
5. Formal proposals require approval from the DAO creator, who commits to fulfilling the proposal.
6. Informal proposals are automatically accepted and made visible to all users.
7. The DAO owner holds the authority to accept or reject formal proposals, with the entire history visible to all users.
8. Once a proposal is accepted, all Mystra users can cast their votes for or against it.
9. Following user votes, Mystra Oracle verifies voter eligibility (checking Mystra Premium Pass ownership, staking, etc.) and, if eligible, records Mystra Points on-chain (acting as vote power).
10. After the proposal's designated lifetime, voting is no longer possible. Mystra Oracle concludes the proposal, and the results are displayed on the project profile page.
11. Users who participated in the vote receive Mystra Points. Points are allocated to the users when they vote in favor of an accepted proposal or against a rejected proposal.

PROJECT INCUBATION:
12. The project establishes its DAO on the Mystra platform, encapsulating all project details. This includes specifying the quantity of tokens allocated for distribution to participants, the amount raised from these tokens to fund project completion, the incubation period's conclusion time, and undergoing the KYB process on the
Mystra platform.
13. Users express their intention to participate in the incubated project. Token
allocation assigned to a user is determined by the user's accumulated points on
the Mystra platform, representing a percentage of the user's share from the
available token pool. This token pool is under the purview of the project's DAO in the incubator and launchpad. Participation in incubation and the launchpad is
exclusive to users holding at least one Mystra Premium Pass, staking a minimum
of 5k CSPR on the Mystra validator or $MYSTRA token, and having successfully
completed all account verification stages on the Mystra platform (KYC).
14. If the total funds declared by users for investment are less than the project's declared fundraising goal, the project does not proceed to the launchpad and is deemed "not reached." If the total funds declared by users equal or exceed the funds collected by the DAO, the project successfully undergoes the incubation process and will be listed on the launchpad.
15. A user who declared participation in token acquisition during the incubation stage can make a purchase in the incubator. Failure to fulfill the declared purchase in the incubator may result in restrictions imposed on the user's account.

LAUNCHPAD:
16. Upon the conclusion of the designated incubation period and the attainment of specified goals, the DAO project proceeds to the launchpad, initiating the
fundraising process from users who declared their participation during the
incubation stage.
17. The DAO project contributes Initial Liquidity to the token liquidity pool based on the defined principles outlined in the project's roadmap, preceding the initial token distribution tranche to users ("vesting"). The added liquidity to the token is locked for a specified duration. The distribution of DAO project tokens adheres to the project's defined Cliff & Vesting rules.

KPIs FOR DAO GOVERNANCE:
18. Successfully conducted at least 2 community votes.
19. Voting results visible on the Casper Network. Verification of deployments of
interactions with DAO contract.
20. Incubated at least two projects on the Mystra platform that successfully undergo the incubation process and enter the launchpad module.
21. Visible interactions (deployments) with contracts of incubated projects on the Casper Network.
22. Visible liquidity pool for tokens (deployments) on the Casper Network, concluding the process in the Launchpad module.
