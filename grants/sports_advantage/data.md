The Sports Advantage Marketplace is a platform that efficiently connects racing teams with potential
sponsors. Our solution scales the sponsorship process by providing a marketplace with available
sponsorship opportunities.
The project brings sports sponsorship closer to the fans, it allows a wider interaction between the teams
and their fans. This is only possible by converting the sponsorship and experiences to digital assets on
the blockchain. A race car is sponsored via advertisement real estate on the car, “Ad Spot”. By
converting the final Ad Spot into an NFT, we unlock the potential for primary and secondary markets.
Sponsorship revenues are also achieved through the sale of experience and merchandise to sponsors
and to fans.


Each category is composed of seasons, the seasons have events, and cars participate in those events.
Our platform will list each car’s Ad spots in each event, and for every season to be sold as an NFT. The
second items sold on the platform are the “Experiences” like VIP Access, Photos with the driver, and
many more. Those items will also be listed on the marketplace and they are tied to the same structure
outlined above.

To put it in perspective, if a single car can have 50 ad spots, those will be multiplied by the events and
the seasons. In addition, experiences will provide an additional multiplier.
We think that building it on Casper will not only provide sports sponsorship access to the Casper
Ecosystem but also will result in added value for the teams, drivers, and the industry.

Finally, the transparency that blockchain brings will lead to the onboarding of the teams, team members,
sponsors, and fans to the Casper ecosystem.

This proposed project holds significant promise in revolutionizing the relationship between sports
sponsorships, fan engagement, and blockchain technology within the Casper ecosystem. Let’s delve
into the detailed benefits and implications:

Enhancing Fan Interaction and Engagement:
Closer Fan-Team Interaction: By tokenizing sports sponsorships and experiences into digital assets on
the blockchain, the project facilitates a direct and immersive connection between fans and their favorite
teams/drivers. This bridges the gap, enabling fans to participate actively beyond mere spectatorship.
Wider Accessibility: The conversion of sponsorships and experiences into NFTs allows for a broader
reach and accessibility, allowing fans worldwide to engage with and potentially own a piece of their
favorite team’s history.
Unlocking New Market Opportunities:
NFT Market Expansion: The conversion of ad spots and experiences into NFTs creates primary and
secondary markets. This not only introduces new revenue streams for teams and drivers but also
fosters a thriving marketplace for collectors and enthusiasts interested in these unique digital assets.
Multiplier Effect: The multiplication of ad spots across events and seasons, coupled with additional
experiences, amplifies the market potential, creating a dynamic ecosystem for both primary and
secondary sales.
Benefits to Casper Ecosystem:
Value Addition: Integrating this project into the Casper ecosystem brings intrinsic value real estate on
the car, “Ad Spot”. By converting the final Ad Spot into an NFT, we unlock the potential for primary and
secondary markets. Similarly other assets are able to be minted on the Casper network.
Each category is composed of seasons, the seasons have events, and cars participate in those events.
Our platform will list each car’s Ad spots in each event, and for every season to be sold as an NFT.

This proposed project holds significant promise in revolutionizing the relationship between sports
sponsorships, fan engagement, and blockchain technology within the Casper ecosystem. Let’s delve
into the detailed benefits and implications:
by expanding the use case and utility of the platform. It diversifies the application of blockchain
technology beyond traditional domains, attracting sports enthusiasts and participants to the ecosystem.
Transparency and Trust: Leveraging blockchain’s transparency ensures trust and accountability in
sponsorships, transactions, and ownership rights. This transparency is pivotal in attracting teams,
sponsors, and fans into the Casper ecosystem, fostering a community built on trust.
Industry Advancement:
Innovation in Sports Sponsorship: The project represents a pioneering approach to sports sponsorship
by leveraging blockchain and NFTs, potentially setting a new standard for the industry.
Economic Empowerment: Teams, drivers, and stakeholders benefit from increased monetization
opportunities through the tokenization of ad spots and experiences, potentially transforming the
economics of sports sponsorship.
