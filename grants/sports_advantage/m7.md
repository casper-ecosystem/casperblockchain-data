### Description

Onboarding and integration of up to 6 additional racing team+series pairs using the Sports Advantage
Marketplace on Casper. Each additional racing team fully onboarded will be rewarded separately in this
milestone.
For clarity, TEAM A + SERIES A = 1 team+series pair, TEAM A + SERIES B = 2 team+series pair.
Each team+series pair has the opportunity to open up a new set of ads for the marketplace. For
example, team may participate in Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup and Porsche Carrera Cup Deutschland,
same team + driver, but different sponsors.
It is understood that Sports Advantage will make reasonable efforts to drive high value items to be
minted as NFTs. Both volume and value of NFTs are important for Casper to drive use of the Casper
Network.

### Acceptance Criteria

Up to 6 extra unique team+series pairs fully onboarded and integrated with the Sports Advantage
Marketplace on Casper (Mainnet).
Link showing the asset NFTs minting on the mainnet: minimum of 30 NFTs of any category minted on
mainnet per team & series onboarded, following the software architecture defined and agreed on
previous milestones.
