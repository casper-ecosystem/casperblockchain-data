### Description

This milestone covers the process of creating final end-to-end tests of all parts of the application.
Potential bugs found during the process will be fixed.
Additionally, the functional and technical documentation will be prepared, with a focus on integrating external applications (like frontend implementation).

### Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: It is possible to run backend end-to-end test on the test network, that will cover functional use cases of the application like updating configuration, managing membership, processing the bid escrow, etc.
- AC2: If the manual tests or possible external audit discovers some bugs, those will be fixed.
- AC3: Technical and functional documentation is prepared
