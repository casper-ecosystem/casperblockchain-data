### Description

The following milestone provides the implementation of a set of contracts, some of them based on ERC20 and ERC721 standards, that will be used throughout the implementation process:
- Reputation Token - ERC20, holds the information about the reputation of the DAO member
- VA Token - ERC721 - defines who is the VA
- KYC Token - ERC721 - defines who has completed the KYC process
- Variable Repository - holds the parameters for all other contracts, like Quorums, Policing rates, etc.
Additionally, it will include the work needed for the project bootstrapping - preparation of the repository, pipelines, testing frameworks, environments and documentation format.

### Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: Github repository is set up - with automated tests run via pipeline
- AC2: All contracts prepared in this milestone are documented
- AC3: Reputation Token, VA Token, KYC Token and Variable Repository contracts are implemented, tests can be run against them and they can be successfully deployed on the test network
